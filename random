I have worked with Kunal for more than a year and had many opportunities to observe his professional attitude.During this period I have worked with him on various e-commerce and e-learning projects. The best thing that I have observed in him is that he is 
a self starter and carries a very sincere attitude towards his work. 

He has worked with me in capacity of Test Professional and has strong analytical and reasoning skills. In addition to this he has also been very diligent in the task assigned to him. I also found him to be comfortable in programming languages, and with his prior experience of writing test automation scripts he has been able to contribute above expectations. 

I have seen him driving new initiatives multiple times which made him an asset for the team. He performed automation of various critical functionality of the project that we were working on. There has been instances where he received appreciation from the client's side as he had a very unique approach of looking at things and an eye for details. He has been able to deliver a good quality work through out, maintaning a very positive attitude in the team at all times.


Considering all these points, I would strongly recommend Kunal Dwivedi for the MS programme in Management of Information Systems at your university. His ability to assess the business needs from the customer's view pont and technical bent of mind makes him an ideal candidate for this course.
